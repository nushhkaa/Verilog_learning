# Verilog Practice

Welcome to the **Verilog Practice** repository! This is a personal collection of my learning journey with Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The repository includes beginner-level practice codes, exploratory projects, and will eventually house a complete processor design I'm currently working on.

## What This Repo Contains

-  **Introductory Verilog Programs**: Basic syntax and fundamental constructs.
-  **Practice Modules**: Small modules to test different Verilog concepts (e.g., always blocks, FSMs, mux/demux, etc.).
-  **Testbenches**: Simulations to validate each module's functionality.
-  **Processor Design (WIP)**: An evolving project that will implement a custom-designed processor from the ground up.
