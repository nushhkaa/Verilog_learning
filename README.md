# Verilog Practice Repository

Welcome to my Verilog HDL practice repository!
This repository is a collection of my initial and practice codes written in **Verilog Hardware Description Language**. It will grow as I continue learning and working on more complex designs, including a **processor design project** as part of my final project.
